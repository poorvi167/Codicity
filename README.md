# Codicity

The goal of this project is to provide a universal platform for the students that can cater for coding tests varying from a 'beginner' to an 'expert' skill level. The platform would contain a knowledge-base of questions that would be presented to the students. Upon completion of the test, based on the results, the platform would be able to automatically suggest the path going forward, whether the student lacks skills and needs to learn more, or they are proficient in their current skill level and can be moved to a new level, with question getting more complex. The platform could also be used to provide necessary notes/videos/resources for the students to learn how to solve a particular kind of problem if needed.
